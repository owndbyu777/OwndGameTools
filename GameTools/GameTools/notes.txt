Thoughts on protocols
- have a row above the table which is the protocol row
  - always has a textbox to edit the name of the col
  - has a edit button on each row which allows you to edit
  - the finer details of the row eg: what data is allowed to be entered into the cols



  XML PARSING
   - REDO IT TO USE LINQ to XML
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt693062.aspx
   has great reasons why it should be done.

   Using XmlDocument is the DOM way of doing it,
   LINQ is the redesigned updated version of DOM (sort of)

   TODO: 
    2 ProtoCols can choose between textarea and textbox

    1 ProtoCol can have a flag called ID. If the col is an ID column
   the value of each row in each column is the index of the row.
